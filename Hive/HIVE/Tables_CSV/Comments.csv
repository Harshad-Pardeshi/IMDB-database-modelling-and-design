1,"There is no way I'd watch that movie and support the crap Hollywood did to that baby to make this sick show. I just saw the previews today when I went to the movies; (then tonight noticed it was also on as an ad during the ""Desperate Housewives"" show I taped last week).",Oct 1 2010 22:02:15,1
2,Wow! Time for you to get therapy. You are totally in needs of meds.,Oct 2 2010 18:36:23,1
3,No matter how cute some of the dialogue is or how hot the stars are; there is no excuse for child endangerment as seen in this movie. The baby was ignored; dropped; and left with a cab driver instead of a baby sitter. I left the preview with a sick feeling. Only Hollywood could think this is funny.,Sep 30 2010 20:36:08,2
4,I am pretty sure if they are stupid enough to mimic what is done in movies and have a history of doing just down right ignorant things; it is safe to say nobody will leave their child to them..,Oct 1 2010 06:36:14,2
5,I'm confused in this scene when Edward says I never treated you like a hooker and Vivian says you just did. How did he treat her like a hooker?,Nov 2 2015 16:44:51,3
6,Edward wanted to put Vivian up at an apartment instead of making a commitment and living together. Basically; she felt that she was being asked to be his personal hooker that he can visit any time and have sex with.,Dec 3 2015 00:08:20,3
7,Extremely attractive woman becomes a prostitute because she is desperate and a 'friend' convinces her that it is glamorous. She is hired by an extremely wealthy man who wants her for everything but sex. They fall in love and a happy ending (non-euphemistically) ensues.,Apr 15 2009 05:32:21,4
8,"Edward (Gere) saw something special in her other than physical attraction. He saw her as a person; not an item. Vivien (Roberts) was distrusting in the world and only had one ""friend."" She never thought she was special. So... When Edward was willing to devote all his time to her NOT just for sex; she felt like the real Vivien. Not the ""What do you want my name to be?"" prostitute.",Apr 15 2009 10:23:28,4
9,Yeah; another message from Hollywood. If you're a hot guy stalking a girl you don't know and travel across the country to bump into her; you can get lucky!!!,Apr 20 2012 06:41:01,5
10,that's what wrong with society; looks determine everything.,Apr 20 2012 12:47:25,5
11,Since her picture was in Iraq; that means someone took it with them. Does that mean someone close to her died in Iraq? Who was it?,Feb 17 2012 12:30:00,6
12,Because the entire movie doesn't look interesting to me. I'm only curious about this one thing.,Feb 20 2012 15:10:32,6
13,Anybody else know who she was all along?,Nov 9 2013 21:51:08,7
14,"I figured it out when they were walking & she pointed out the ""flying fish"" in Lexie's drawing.",Nov 10 2013 08:08:06,7
15,Too bad. I don't share your reaction. I thought she and her acting very appropriate to the character.,Jun 7 2013 13:07:22,8
16,I loved her acting; I thought she was absolutely adorable!,Jun 7 2013 20:13:22,8
17,Or did he just do it? I couldn't tell if Jamie was surprised or not,Aug 27 2014 12:45:58,9
18,How long were they married before she died?,Aug 27 2014 13:39:38,9
19,As he went up to Jamie's front porch following that hall scene; he did have a very apprehensive expression; so he knew he may have blown it with regards to Jamie's help. And of course she confirms this when she opens the door; sees who is standing there; and calmly closes the door -- without a word.,Oct 8 2014 17:10:09,10
20,Rest in peace; Roger Ebert. You were the best.,Oct 14 2014 08:51:22,10
21,I thought it was a fantastic movie. My only complaint was that the young Dawson looks nothing like James Marsden. Other than that I really enjoyed it. Everyone's so harsh.,Oct 17 2014 23:38:19,11
22,Totally unrelated; but just had to say.....Best signature ever. Half the people on here should have that; lol.,Jan 18 2015 01:58:24,11
23,I liked it until the ending.,Oct 18 2014 16:12:00,11
24,Agreed. It was actually really good up until; I'd say; the last 25 minutes. Then it got unforgivably cheesy and far-fetched. If the ending was better; this would be a very solid romantic drama.,Oct 18 2014 17:01:44,11
25,yea; totally. Cyclops doesn't die that easily. completely unrealistic!!!,Dec 20 2014 15:25:51,11
