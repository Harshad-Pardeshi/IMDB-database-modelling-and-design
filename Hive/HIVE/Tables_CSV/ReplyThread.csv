,"I have emetophobia- severe phobia of vomiting. Are there any vomiting scenes and if so, could you please tell me approx where/when?! ",8/10/2010,1,
,Just returning from the screening. I dont recon any vomiting scenes. Movie is fine but it is what we expect.,03-23-1990,2,
,"I'd actually really like to know the answer... because I was in the movie and one of the scenes had me vomiting. Hoping it didn't get cut,",04-20-2012,3,
,"You know what come to think of it, i think there was a scene with someone throwing up. Plus there is a scene where Jason Bateman drinks eggnog (which looks like semen) out of a statue's penis and then spits it out, that is kinda gross.",02-14-2013,4,
,If it was someone puking into a filing cabinet that's me!,01-25-2002,5,
,Errrr...i dont remember that. But i have bad memory and the loud *beep* next to me was distracting me.,10-17-2014,6,
,Thanks all who have replied so far. ,02-14-2007,7,
,Just watched it (pre-release here in The Netherlands). Can't recall seeing any vomiting.,07-24-2009,8,
,"Wow Ed, I hope for my sake it was cut but then again not- for your sake lol.",1/6/2007,9,
,"I just watched the new trailer last night and I'm somewhat excited. It looks good and has some really good comedic actors but idk it has a big chance of being one of those movies with a good cast that ends up being *beep* and we're all gonna ask ourselves ""how the hell did this people ended up in the movie?"". It looks fine enough, I'll watch it but probably when it comes online, not gonna spend money in it. ",02-13-2004,10,
,"Also, is it just me that thinks that even after all of this time Oliva Munn looks really unnatural on screen? I actually think she's a really funny person in real life but there's just something off about her as an actress",3/9/2010,11,1
,"And yet even with all these hilarious actors and actresses, the film couldn't get past the ""bland, unfunny, predictable, cliched studio comedy"" phase. I'm not even putting this on the script or the director because the concept was actually rather strong and super-relatable, the exact hook that is required for a big comedy hit - and money, well that this film can still make, I'm sure - but for some reason the whole thing just felt rushed af. Maybe if they spent more time in post-production, it could have been actually a good/great comedy but in it's current form, its only saving grace is a kick-ass (literally) Aniston and certain line deliveries courtesy of the aforementioned, supremely talented cast. ",05-28-1999,12,2
,"Between Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Olivia Munn, Kate McKinnon, Vanessa Bayer, Jillian Bell, Courtney B. Vance, T.J. Miller, Rob Corddry, Randall Park, Jamie Chung, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Fortune Feimster, Sam Richardson, this film must have ONE of the most accomplished comedic ensembles ever. ",7/2/2003,13,3
,"In other words, this is yet another mainstream raunch comedy made by filmmakers who didn't try or even give a damn.",04-13-2001,14,4
,Just saw the clip on Ellen show and the little girl Darcy looks like Summer Fontana from the Originals but she isn't credited on IMDB. Anyone know if it's her? I don't even see Darcy's character listed.,12-25-2012,15,5
,"I agree. I watch a LOT of movies - bad and good - and I thought it was generally entertaining and watchable. I liked the plot and, although it wasn't particularly original, I thought the idea of two single friends brought together by tragedy in that way was interesting. I thought Holly and Messer were realistic characters and their relationship development - from people brought together through circumstance to partners - was believable and actually pretty touching in places. ",11/2/2011,16,6
,"I think it was a solid movie and to be quite honest i'm surprised to see that there's a lot of disdain for it on this board & elsewhere.. what do you all think was so bad about it? i liked the leads (i am a KH fan) and the story was well done as was the tone of the film, IMO. So what did u all dislike about it? Or is there anyone w/ me on this? hahah",6/6/2014,17,7
,"law-turley I agree with you. As for the chemistry between the leads, personally I loved it, for me felt very natural, thought I would have loved to see more of them being a couple.",09-26-2014,18,8
